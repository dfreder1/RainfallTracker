	    So how are we doing this year? The chart shows the rainfall accumulation of notable weather seasons, starting on October 1 and continuing through the following April. Values for this season (2015) are updated within 48 hours of being updated on http://cdec.water.ca.gov/cgi-progs/queryDaily?SAE.

	These are Sacramento records from the rain gage at Sacramento Executive Airport, so they don't really tell the whole story. For instance, as of Dec 22, 2015 snow depths in the Sierras are trending higher than last year. I obtained the data for Sacramento from these sources:
	<ul>

	</ul>
	<ul>

	</ul>
	<p>
	In Sacramento, the driest year was 1975 (just 7.25 inches), and the second driest year was the next year at only 7.53 inches.
	</p>
	<p>
	The wettest years in Sacramento are associated with the El Nino patterns of 1982 and 1997. 1982 was the wettest year in Sacramento history since records were kept beginning in 1849 at 37.49 inches. 1997 was the second wettest year of the 20th century in Sacramento at 32.25 inches.
